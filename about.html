		<h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1>
		<strong>V3- Project- Active</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>The 3 column layout using width of ~33% was changed into a table format for V3- this was a major overhaul</li>
			<li>-all flavors are now integrated into a table and the "Flavors" spans the 3 columns to form the header</li>
			<li>The link to V1 project was changed to state "Archived Projects" and now includes V1 and V2 when hovering</li>
			<li>Page response is now mobile friendly, and changes based on screen resolution</li>
			<li>Additional content and sources added</li>
			<li>All images are now placed in a subfolder named "images" to aid with organization</li>
			<li>One major area of difficulty for me: links were moving when on a mobile or tablet resolution- so I used a work around by having a new class of navigation specifically for 480px.</li>
			<li>All pages are now mobile friendly, and adjust contents based on resolution</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>V2- Project- Archive</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>This is my V2 webpage. I have changed a lot since V1. The layout is now in a 3x3 grid along with other cosmetic items, such as new background and image links, borders.</li>
			<li>Based on peer reviews, I have incorporated more progessive enhancement within my page, most notably the colors used.</li>
			<li>One major thing I want to work on for V3 is better page responsiveness. For V2,I kept messing around in Chrome Inspect to see how this would act on a phone. I kept running into issues with sizing and the 3x3 layout not adjusting properly </li>
			<li>Images can now lead to new pages however I still need to add content to each one. </li>
		</ul>
		<strong>V1- Project Archive</strong><br>
		<ul >
			<li>The webpage goes over the different flavors of Moutain Dew and how each one stacks up compared to others.</li>
			<li>V1 is acting as my skeleton webpage that will be built upon. I haven't yet added too much content regarding each flavor, but setup the framework. </li>
			<li>For V2, a layout.css will be added, additional content, and over better structure as skills progress. Some of the content I want to add will include nutritional values </li>
			<li>Each flavor will break out into its own page with both the heading and the image being a link</li>
		</ul>
